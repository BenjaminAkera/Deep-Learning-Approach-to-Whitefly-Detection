# Deep-Learning-Approach-to-Whitefly-Detection
Summer 2017 internship project. Applications of deep learning in the Developing world.

The whitefly is an insect that affects Agricultural crops in Africa, current methods of control involve manually moving through fields 
to count the number of whiteflies per cassava leaf

In this project I propose the use of deep learning to automate this counting process by using an object detection approach.
